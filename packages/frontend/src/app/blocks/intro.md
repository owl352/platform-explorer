Blocks are the fundamental units of a blockchain, serving as containers that hold batches of transactions. Each block is connected to the previous one, forming an immutable chain that ensures the security and integrity of the data.

A blocks contains several key pieces of information:

- [Transactions](/transactions): Each block includes a list of transactions that have been validated and confirmed. Transactions represent the transfer of assets or execution of actions within the network. It's also possible for a block to be empty, containing no transactions, which can occur during periods of low network activity;
- Block Height: This denotes the position of the block within the blockchain. The first block has a height of zero, and each successive block increases the height by one;
- Block Hash: A unique cryptographic hash generated from the block's content. This hash serves as a digital fingerprint of the block and links it to the previous block, ensuring data integrity;
- ID of the validator that processed the block.
