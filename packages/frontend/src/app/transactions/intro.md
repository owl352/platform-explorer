A transaction in the blockchain context represents an action initiated by a participant within the network. This action could involve the transfer of assets, updating data, or executing smart contracts. Transactions are the core operations that enable the blockchain to function as a decentralized ledger.

Transactions can be of various types:

- **[Data Contracts](/dataContracts) create and update:** [Data Contracts](/dataContracts) define the schema and rules for data storage, enabling structured and managed data within the blockchain. Transactions of this types are used to create and update data contracts on the platform.

- **Documents batch:** This type of transaction involves operations with documents. It can include the creation, updating, or deletion of documents.

- **[Identities](/identities) create, update, top up, transfer, and withdrawal:** These transactions are responsible for identity-related actions.

Also each transaction in the blockchain is uniquely identified and contains critical metadata:

- **Transaction Hash:** A unique cryptographic identifier derived from the transactionâ€™s data. It serves as a fingerprint for the transaction, ensuring immutability and facilitating quick lookup and verification.
- **Transaction Height:** The block height at which the transaction was included in the blockchain. This indicates the position of the block containing the transaction within the blockchain, providing a timestamp and historical context for the transaction.
