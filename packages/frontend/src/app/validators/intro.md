Validators on Dash Platform are responsible for maintaining the network's consensus and security. They perform several critical functions:
- **Block Proposal and Validation:** Validators propose new blocks to be added to the blockchain and validate the transactions within them to ensure network consistency;
- **Transaction Processing:** Validators process transactions, verify signatures and ensure that the transactions adhere to network rules;
- **Network Governance:** Validators participate in voting to make decisions on the platform's governance and consensus rules;
- **Uptime Maintenance:** Validators are expected to maintain high uptime to ensure network reliability and availability;
Reward Earning: Validators earn rewards for their services in a process called Proof of Service.
